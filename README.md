# Hello! 👋 I'm Hugo NGUYEN  

Welcome to my GitHub profile!
I recently completed my Master’s degree in Applied Mathematics for Machine Learning at University Paris-Saclay, and I am now pursuing a PhD in Applied Mathematics at École Polytechnique (CMAP).

My research interests are centered on the intersection of  **machine learning**, **financial modeling** and **stochastic processes**.
