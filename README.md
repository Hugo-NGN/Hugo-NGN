# Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Hugo NGUYEN  

Welcome to my GitHub profile! 
I'm currently pursuing an M2 Research in **Applied Mathematics for Machine Learning** at Paris-Saclay and Institut Polytechnique de Paris. My interests lie at the intersection of **financial modeling**, **stochastic process**, **machine learning** and **deep learning**.  

## About Me  

- ðŸ’» **Research Interests**:  
  - Machine Learning and Deep Learning applications in **Quantitative Finance**.  
  - **Time Series Analysis**, especially in clustering and forecasting.
  - Advanced modeling techniques for **credit exposure** and **default risk assessment**  
  - Risk management: Solvency, liquidity, and stress-testing with stochastic processes and neural networks.  

- ðŸ“š **Currently Exploring**:  
  - Neural networks for modeling **variance and mean predictions** in regression problems.  
  - Efficient methods for clustering **time-series datasets**.  
  - Modeling and optimization for **Asset-Liability Management (ALM)**.    .  

- ðŸŒ± **Skills**:  
  - Programming: Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, Keras etc.) and Java      
  - Analytical skills: Statistical analysis, PCA, t-sne ...
